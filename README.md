# PSOAuthClient

An attempt to create a general OAuth2 library for iOS. 

This library is largely inspired by [https://github.com/lukeredpath/LROAuth2Client].

A sample for Google and Facebook has been added to the project. Please have a look at it.

## Steps

1. Configure your credentials in the **PSOAuthClient.h**
2. That's it!!

Give it a spin and do let me know of any issues that you might find.

Thanks!!
